    <h1>Alan Turing - Father of the Modern Computer</h1>

        Alan Turing was a towering figure in computer science and artificial
        intelligence. He is known for his code-breaking abilities during the
        second world war, as well as invention of the Turing test.

    <h2>Here are ten points that illustrates Turing's life.</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Alan Turing was a British mathematician and logician, often considered
        the father of modern computer science.
      </li>
      <li>
        He was born on June 23, 1912, in London, England. Turing studied at both
        Cambridge and Princeton universities, where he established himself as a
        brilliant mathematician.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 1936, Turing proposed a theoretical machine, now known as the Turing
        machine, which became the basis for modern computers.
      </li>
      <li>
        During World War II, he worked at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking
        centre, and was instrumental in breaking the German Enigma code. His
        work on the Enigma code significantly aided the Allies and is thought to
        have shortened the war.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turing was homosexual and was prosecuted for homosexuality in 1952,
        which was then a criminal act in Britain. He agreed to hormone therapy
        (chemical castration) to avoid imprisonment.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 1954, Turing died from cyanide poisoning. An inquest determined his
        death a suicide, but some disputed this conclusion.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turing's contributions to the war effort remained classified in the
        years following his death, but they were later acknowledged, and his
        pioneering work in computer science became widely recognized.
      </li>
      <li>
        In 2013, Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous pardon, and his
        life and work have since received significant public recognition,
        including in popular media.
      </li>
